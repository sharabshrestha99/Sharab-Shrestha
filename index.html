        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Sharab Shrestha, a passionate front-end web developer and
          creative mind with a passion for clean, modern, and accessible design.
          I’m deeply curious about the tech world and constantly leveling up my
          craft — from HTML and CSS to frameworks and libraries. When I'm not
          coding, you’ll find me writing, reading, or philosophizing about life
          and purpose.

          <h3>My Mum — Pralie Pulami Magar</h3>
          <p>
            When I was scared, I had fear <br />
            Holding my hands my mum <br />
            You were close and near. <br />
            When I was frightened with all the tears <br />
            My dear mum you were always there <br />
            To wipe away my tears. <br />
            From the universe and from the rest <br />
            I love you mum <br />
            You are the best. <br />

          <h3>The Road Not Taken — Robert Frost</h3>
          <p>
            Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, <br />
            And sorry I could not travel both <br />
            And be one traveler, long I stood <br />
            And looked down one as far as I could <br />
            To where it bent in the undergrowth; <br />
            <br />
            Then took the other, as just as fair, <br />
            And having perhaps the better claim, <br />
            Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <br />
            Though as for that the passing there <br />
            Had worn them really about the same, <br />
            <br />
            And both that morning equally lay <br />
            In leaves no step had trodden black. <br />
            Oh, I kept the first for another day! <br />
            Yet knowing how way leads on to way, <br />
            I doubted if I should ever come back. <br />
            <br />
            I shall be telling this with a sigh <br />
            Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br />
            Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— <br />
            I took the one less traveled by, <br />
            And that has made all the difference. <br />

          <h3>If — Rudyard Kipling</h3>
          <p>
            If you can keep your head when all about you <br />
            Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, <br />
            If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, <br />
            But make allowance for their doubting too; <br />
            If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, <br />
            Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies, <br />
            Or being hated, don’t give way to hating, <br />
            And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise: <br />
            <br />
            If you can dream—and not make dreams your master; <br />
            If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim; <br />
            If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster <br />
            And treat those two impostors just the same; <br />
            If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken <br />
            Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, <br />
            Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, <br />
            And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools: <br />
            <br />
            If you can make one heap of all your winnings <br />
            And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, <br />
            And lose, and start again at your beginnings <br />
            And never breathe a word about your loss; <br />
            If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew <br />
            To serve your turn long after they are gone, <br />
            And so hold on when there is nothing in you <br />
            Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’ <br />
            <br />
            If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, <br />
            Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch, <br />
            If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, <br />
            If all men count with you, but none too much; <br />
            If you can fill the unforgiving minute <br />
            With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run, <br />
            Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it, <br />
            And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son! <br />
